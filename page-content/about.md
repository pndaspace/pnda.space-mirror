# Me!

I'm **:class{.pink}Holly**! I'm a trans woman (*:class{.pronouns}she/her*),
*:class{.highlight}programmer*, and electronic *:class{.highlight}musician* from the UK. I also have
a bunch of other interests including:

- Bass guitar
- Linux
- Model kits/Gunpla
- Photography
- 80's/90's anime
- Sci-fi literature
- Coffee

I release *:class{.highlight}music* as [collarbone](/music). Typically these tracks fall under the
*:class{.highlight}jungle*, *:class{.highlight}DnB*, or *:class{.highlight}breakcore* genres -
although I have released tunes that fall outside of those classifications. I love experementing with
weird heavy sounds, distortion, and chopping up breaks in unique ways. I also play 
*:class{.highlight}bass*.

I've been a professional *:class{.highlight}full stack dev* since 2020, but I've been messing around
with programming and tech stuff since I was a teenager.

# This Site

This is a silly little *:class{.highlight}personal project* I've been working on, mainly as an
excuse to explore the creative side of web design, I take heavy inspiration from the 
[Web Revival](https://wiki.melonland.net/web_revival)/Indie Web scenes. Some specific examples
can be found on my [links](/links) page. I think personal sites can be an exciting form of personal
expression.

I built this site on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/?uwu=true) framework, with as little client side
JS as I can manage (a lot of stuff is done with css animations). Obviously this is still bulkier
than a "purer" static site, but it's what I'm comfortable using.

The sick *:class{.highlight}ASCII art* text uses samurlwechtrom's
[react-ascii-text](https://github.com/samuelweckstrom/react-ascii-text) library with the
[Elite](https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts/blob/master/Elite.flf) Figlet font. I use
[Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) for my site's theming and generate my page/blog content from
Markdown with [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and
[rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).
