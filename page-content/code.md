Here are some small hobby projects I have been working on. For my Linux stuff I mostly use 
*:class{.highlight}C* and *:class{.highlight}POSIX shell* scripts. I work with
*:class{.highlight}TypeScript*, *:class{.highlight}React* and *:class{.highlight}C#* for my day job.
My main repository host is on [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.org/pndaspace/), and I have a secondary
[GitHub](https://github.com/pndaspace) account for contributing.
