Hiii Welcome to my little blog :) I'm basically just making this post so I have something here while
I work on making the site. It's been pretty fun actually - I dont get a lot of chance to mess around
with designs like this in my day job and Next.js is pretty alright to use coming from a pure React
backgound. I wanted to do this in HTMX but honestly it's a lot of work learning something like that
and I wanted to focus more on the visuals anyway, so having static components is a nice compromise.

Anyway I have a bunch of ideas for stuff to write here so hopefully you'll be seeing that soon. Some
new music too this week if all goes well :3
